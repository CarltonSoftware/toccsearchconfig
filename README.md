TOCC Search Config
==================

This module uses both the tabs-api-client module and aw-form-fields module.  Please make sure you have access to the tabs-api-client before installing this.

To install, run `install.sh`.  The script will create a libraries folder and clone the two git repo's into it.  You will need to create a `config.php` file (see `config.sample.php`) with your api url, key and secret in it to connect to the api.
